        <h1>For Babu Janu</h1>
        <p>Happy Birthday, Hetvi! 🎉 On this special day dedicated to you, I want to send my warmest wishes for a year filled with joy, success, and unforgettable moments. May every dream you have for the coming year find its way into reality.As I celebrate your birthday from a distance, I can't help but reflect on the unique bond we shared, even if it was just a brief meeting. You're not just a friend but my only Hindi-speaking companion in this college journey. Your presence added a special vibrancy, and your absence is palpable.
May your day be as extraordinary as the impression you've made on me. Happy Birthday, Darling! Here's to the hope that our paths cross again soon, bringing back the laughter, stories, and the comfort of Hindi conversations that I deeply cherish..</p>
